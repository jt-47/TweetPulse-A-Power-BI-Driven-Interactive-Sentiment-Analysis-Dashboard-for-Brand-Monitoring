The objective of this project is to develop a Real-time system that analyzes Twitter data using the hashtag #Apple to assess public sentiment toward the Apple brand. 

This system aims to provide valuable insights into sentiment trends, helping Apple with reputation management and the strategic alignment of marketing campaigns through continuous monitoring and analysis of social media sentiment in an interactive and dynamic dashboard.
